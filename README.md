# ☎️ Simple Phone System in Java

This is a basic Java project that simulates a **simple phone system** with key smartphone-like functionalities, using object-oriented programming principles such as **classes**, **interfaces**, and **encapsulation**.

## 🧩 Project Structure

- `controller/` → Contains the main system interfaces.
- `utils/` → Contains specific implementations like `Spotify`.
- `model/` → Contains the `Iphone` class, simulating a smartphone device.
- `Main.java` → The main execution class.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project was developed as an **exercise proposed by the Bradesco Bootcamp in partnership with DIO** (Digital Innovation One).  
Its main purpose is to **practice Java classes, interfaces, and encapsulation** in a real-world simulation context.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎶 Music playback system using the `MusicPlayer` interface implemented by `Spotify`.
- 🌐 Web navigation simulation via the `InternetExplorer` interface implemented by `Safari`.
- 📞 Phone call functionalities through the `CallingSystem` interface implemented by `Phone`.
